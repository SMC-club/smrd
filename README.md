# What is SMR?
SMR is a network of computers which use the [Ripple consensus algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj1QVb1vlC0) to atomically settle and record
transactions on a secure distributed database, the SMR Consensus Ledger
(RCL). Because of its distributed nature, the RCL offers transaction immutability
without a central operator. The RCL contains a built-in currency exchange and its
path-finding algorithm finds competitive exchange rates across order books
and currency pairs.

### Key Features
- **Distributed**
  - Direct account-to-account settlement with no central operator
  - Decentralized global market for competitive FX
- **Secure**
  - Transactions are cryptographically signed using ECDSA
  - Multi-signing capabilities
- **Scalable**
  - Capacity to process the world’s cross-border payments volume
  - Easy access to liquidity through a competitive FX marketplace
